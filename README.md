# Game-of-Thrones-Prediction
This python ML model reads in every line from Game of Thrones and uses character-prediction to determine the script's next letter based upon the previous 50 letters. When given a starter string, it produces readable output that usually aligns with each character's personality. For example:

tyrion lannister

In ferticing you now? Why? Why did you tell him to do with that again? 
  
jon snow

tormund

arya stark

jorah mormont
